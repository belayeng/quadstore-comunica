# immutable-replacement

This package provides an alternative implementation of [immutable][1]'s
persistent data structures, tailored for use within Comunica.

The goal for this alternative implementation is to maintain similar performance
levels while significantly reducing the size of the package itself.

This package *is not a universal replacement for immutable* as it only
implements the specific data structures required by Comunica.
