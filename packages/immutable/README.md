# immutable

This package is used as a replacement for the well-known [`immutable`][1]
package by `quadstore-comunica`'s build system.

This package only exports a `Map` class, which is the only export amongst
all of `immutable`'s exports that Comunica actually uses.

This package is not published to NPM.
